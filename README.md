A dynamic web page that renders images on a canvas based on scroll position. This project showcases a unique approach to image rendering, where the canvas dynamically updates with a new image as the user scrolls through the page.

## Features

* Dynamically loads and renders images on a canvas based on scroll position
* Utilizes the GSAP library for smooth animation and scroll triggering
* Supports a large number of images (up to 195 in this implementation)
* Images are fetched from a remote source and cached for performance

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for animation and scroll triggering
* Canvas API for dynamic image rendering

## How it Works

1. The project preloads a series of images (in this case, 195 images) from a remote source.
2. As the user scrolls through the page, the GSAP library triggers the animation based on the scroll position.
3. The animation updates the canvas with a new image corresponding to the current scroll position.
4. The canvas dynamically resizes and scales the image to fit the viewport.

## Challenges and Solutions

* One of the primary challenges was managing the loading and caching of a large number of images. This was addressed by using a preload function to load all images initially and store them in an array for later use.
* Another challenge was ensuring smooth animation and image rendering during scroll. This was achieved by using GSAP's ScrollTrigger plugin, which allows for precise control over animation timing and scroll position.

## Future Improvements

* Implementing a more efficient image loading mechanism to reduce initial load times.
* Adding support for different image formats and sizes.
* Enhancing the user experience with additional interactive elements or animations.

## Conclusion

The render-image-on-canvas-on-scroll project demonstrates a unique approach to dynamic image rendering on the web. By leveraging the power of GSAP and the Canvas API, this project showcases a seamless and engaging user experience.
